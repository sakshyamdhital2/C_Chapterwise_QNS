Q2. Quadratic Equation Program Gives Incorrect Output
(a) Identify the Error
The program runs but gives wrong output
Therefore, the error is a Logical Error
 Syntax Error → program won’t compile
 Runtime Error → program crashes
 Logical Error → program runs but result is wrong

 (c) Compilation and Execution in C
Compilation
The compiler checks:
-Syntax errors
-Converts C code into machine code
-If errors exist → program does not compile
Execution
-After successful compilation:
-Program is loaded into memory
-Instructions are executed line by line
-Output is displayed
