Q3. Program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle
1. Problem Analysis

The program calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle using its length and breadth.
Input: Length (L), Breadth (B)
Process:
Area = L × B
Perimeter = 2 × (L + B)
Output: Area and Perimeter

2. Algorithm
step:1 Start
step:2 Declare variables L, B, Area, Perimeter
step:3 Input length and breadth
step:4 Calculate Area = L × B
step:5 Calculate Perimeter = 2 × (L + B)
step:6 Display area and perimeter
step:7 Stop
